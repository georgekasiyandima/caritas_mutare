## üåê Vercel Deployment Steps

### Step 1: Prepare the Repository
The repository is already set up and pushed to GitHub:
- **Repository**: `https://github.com/georgekasiyandima/caritas_mutare`
- **Branch**: `main`
- **Status**: ‚úÖ Up to date

### Step 2: Vercel Configuration

#### Option A: Deploy via Vercel Dashboard (Recommended)
1. Go to [vercel.com](https://vercel.com)
2. Sign in with your GitHub account
3. Click "Add New Project"
4. Import `georgekasiyandima/caritas_mutare` repository
5. Configure project settings:
   - **Framework Preset**: Create React App
   - **Root Directory**: `client`
   - **Build Command**: `npm run build`
   - **Output Directory**: `build`
   - **Install Command**: `npm install`

#### Option B: Deploy via Vercel CLI
```bash
# Install Vercel CLI globally
npm install -g vercel

# Navigate to client directory
cd client

# Deploy to Vercel
vercel

# Follow the prompts:
# - Set up and deploy? Yes
# - Which scope? Your account
# - Link to existing project? No
# - Project name? caritas-mutare
# - Directory? ./
# - Override settings? No
```

### Step 3: Environment Variables (If Needed)
Currently, the prototype doesn't require environment variables. For future production:
- `REACT_APP_API_URL`: Backend API endpoint
- `REACT_APP_GOOGLE_MAPS_API_KEY`: For enhanced map features
- `REACT_APP_ANALYTICS_ID`: Google Analytics tracking

### Step 4: Custom Domain (Optional)
Once deployed, you can add a custom domain:
1. Go to Project Settings ‚Üí Domains
2. Add domain (e.g., `caritasmutare.org.zw`)
3. Configure DNS settings as instructed by Vercel

## üîß Build Configuration

### Vercel Configuration File
Create `vercel.json` in the root directory:

```json
{
  "version": 2,
  "builds": [
    {
      "src": "client/package.json",
      "use": "@vercel/static-build",
      "config": {
        "distDir": "build"
      }
    }
  ],
  "routes": [
    {
      "src": "/static/(.*)",
      "dest": "/client/build/static/$1"
    },
    {
      "src": "/(.*)",
      "dest": "/client/build/index.html"
    }
  ]
}
```

### Build Settings
- **Build Command**: `cd client && npm install && npm run build`
- **Output Directory**: `client/build`
- **Install Command**: `cd client && npm install`

---

## üß™ Testing Before Deployment

### Local Build Test
```bash
# Navigate to client directory
cd client

# Create production build
npm run build

# Test the build locally
npx serve -s build
```

### Check for Issues
- ‚úÖ All pages load correctly
- ‚úÖ Images display properly
- ‚úÖ Navigation works smoothly
- ‚úÖ Mobile responsiveness
- ‚úÖ Forms are functional (Contact, Volunteer, Donate)
- ‚úÖ No console errors

---

## üì± Post-Deployment Verification

### Essential Checks
1. **Homepage**: Verify hero section, statistics, and programs display
2. **Programs Page**: Check all 6 programs load with correct information
3. **Soup Kitchen Page**: Verify images load and gallery works
4. **Leadership Page**: Check partner logos display correctly
5. **Contact Page**: Verify map loads and contact form works
6. **Mobile View**: Test on various screen sizes
7. **Navigation**: Ensure all links work correctly
8. **WhatsApp Widget**: Test WhatsApp integration
9. **Back-to-Top Button**: Verify functionality
10. **Language Switcher**: Test English/Shona translation

---

## üîí Security Considerations

### Current Status
- ‚úÖ No sensitive data exposed
- ‚úÖ HTTPS enabled by default on Vercel
- ‚úÖ No API keys in frontend code
- ‚úÖ Form validation implemented

### Future Recommendations
- Implement CAPTCHA for forms (Google reCAPTCHA)
- Add rate limiting for form submissions
- Implement Content Security Policy (CSP)
- Regular security audits

---

## üìä Performance Optimization

### Already Implemented
- ‚úÖ Image optimization (compressed images)
- ‚úÖ Code splitting with React Router
- ‚úÖ Lazy loading for components
- ‚úÖ Efficient state management

### Future Improvements
- [ ] Implement CDN for images
- [ ] Add service worker for offline support
- [ ] Implement image lazy loading
- [ ] Optimize bundle size

---

## üêõ Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

#### Build Fails
**Problem**: Build fails with dependency errors
**Solution**: 
```bash
cd client
rm -rf node_modules package-lock.json
npm install
npm run build
```

#### Images Not Loading
**Problem**: Images return 404 errors
**Solution**: Ensure images are in `client/public/images/` directory and paths start with `/images/`

#### Routing Issues
**Problem**: Direct URL access returns 404
**Solution**: Ensure Vercel is configured for SPA routing (see vercel.json above)

#### Blank Page After Deployment
**Problem**: Site loads but shows blank page
**Solution**: Check browser console for errors, verify build output directory

## üìà Analytics & Monitoring

### Recommended Tools
1. **Google Analytics**: Track visitor behavior
2. **Vercel Analytics**: Built-in performance monitoring
3. **Sentry**: Error tracking and monitoring
4. **Hotjar**: User behavior analysis

### Implementation (Future)
```bash
# Install analytics packages
npm install react-ga4 @sentry/react
```

---

## üîÑ Continuous Deployment

### Automatic Deployments
Vercel automatically deploys when you push to GitHub:
- **Production**: Pushes to `main` branch
- **Preview**: Pull requests and other branches

### Manual Deployment
```bash
# Deploy to production
vercel --prod

# Deploy to preview
vercel
```
